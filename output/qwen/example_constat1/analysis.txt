**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

1.  **Initial Situation:** Vehicle B was driving on Rue de la Libération and was turning right into another street (or onto a different path).
2.  **Vehicle A's Action:** Vehicle A was following Vehicle B in the same direction and lane. The driver of Vehicle A was not using a turn signal, which is a violation of traffic rules.
3.  **Collision:** Vehicle A failed to maintain a safe distance and rear-ended Vehicle B. The impact occurred because Vehicle A was not aware of Vehicle B's turn (due to the lack of a turn signal) and was not able to stop in time.
4.  **Result:** Vehicle A's right bumper was damaged, and Vehicle B's right rear bumper corner was damaged.

---

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Based on French traffic law and the circumstances, **Vehicle A (Aymeric FAURE) is primarily at fault**.

*   **Reasoning:** The key factor is that Vehicle A was following Vehicle B and rear-ended it. While Vehicle B was turning right, the primary responsibility for safe following and maintaining a safe distance lies with the following vehicle (Vehicle A). The fact that Vehicle A did not use a turn signal (as noted in the driver's observation) is a clear violation of traffic rules, which could be considered a contributory factor, but it does not absolve Vehicle A of fault for failing to maintain a safe distance. In French traffic law, the driver who fails to maintain a safe distance and causes a rear-end collision is typically considered at fault, regardless of the other vehicle's actions (like turning). The driver of Vehicle B was turning, which is a maneuver that requires caution, but the collision was caused by Vehicle A's failure to follow at a safe distance.

**7. CONCLUSION**

The accident occurred on 09/10/2024 at 12:14 on Rue de la Libération, where Vehicle A (Aymeric FAURE) rear-ended Vehicle B (Anne KERVRIAN) while following it. Vehicle A was not using a turn signal and failed to maintain a safe distance, which is the primary cause of the collision. Therefore, Vehicle A is at fault for the accident.
