**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

Based on the checked boxes, the accident likely occurred as follows:

1.  **Vehicle B** was pulling out of a parking space or driveway (Box 3 checked).
2.  **Vehicle A** was driving in the same direction as Vehicle B but in a different lane (Box 9 checked).
3.  **Vehicle A** was not observing a traffic signal or priority sign (Box 17 checked).
4.  **Vehicle A** may have been pulling out of a parking space or driveway (Box 3 marked with a faint scribble, UNCERTAIN).

The accident likely occurred when Vehicle A, which was not observing a traffic signal or priority sign, collided with Vehicle B, which was pulling out of a parking space or driveway.

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Based on French traffic law and the circumstances:

*   **Vehicle A is likely at fault.** The primary reason is that Vehicle A was not observing a traffic signal or priority sign (Box 17 checked), which is a clear violation of traffic rules. In French law, drivers have a duty to observe traffic signals and signs, and failure to do so is a significant contributing factor to accidents.
*   **Vehicle B may also share some responsibility.** While pulling out of a parking space or driveway (Box 3 checked) is a common maneuver, drivers must still exercise caution and check for oncoming traffic. However, since Vehicle A was not observing a traffic signal or priority sign, Vehicle A is primarily at fault.
