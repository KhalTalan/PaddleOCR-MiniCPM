**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

Based on the checked boxes and the visual evidence:

1.  Both vehicles were parked (stationnement) at the time of the accident.
2.  Vehicle A was parked, and Vehicle B was parked.
3.  Vehicle B was positioned behind Vehicle A, and Vehicle B was blocking Vehicle A at the rear (blocage à l'arrière).
4.  The accident occurred when Vehicle B, while parked, was blocking Vehicle A, which was also parked.
5.  The accident likely occurred because Vehicle B was parked in a way that blocked Vehicle A's path, and Vehicle A was unable to move forward or backward due to the blockage.

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Based on French traffic law and the circumstances:

*   **Vehicle B (Right):** The driver of Vehicle B is likely at fault. According to French traffic law, drivers must park in a way that does not obstruct the flow of traffic or the movement of other vehicles. By parking in a way that blocked Vehicle A, the driver of Vehicle B violated this rule.
*   **Vehicle A (Left):** The driver of Vehicle A is not at fault. The driver of Vehicle A was parked and had no control over the situation. The accident was caused by the driver of Vehicle B's parking.

**7. CONCLUSION**

The accident occurred when Vehicle B, while parked, blocked Vehicle A, which was also parked. The driver of Vehicle B is likely at fault for parking in a way that obstructed the movement of another vehicle. The driver of Vehicle A is not at fault.
