**4. CIRCUMSTANCES SUMMARY**

Based on the verified checkboxes, the following circumstances were reported:

*   **Both vehicles were parked (stationnement):** Both drivers checked box 1, indicating that both vehicles were parked at the time of the accident.
*   **Vehicle A was moving:** Vehicle A checked box 9, indicating that it was "moving in the same direction as the other vehicle, but on a different lane." This suggests Vehicle A was in motion, likely leaving a parking spot or maneuvering within a parking area.
*   **Vehicle B was stationary:** Vehicle B did not check any boxes, indicating that it was stationary at the time of the accident.

---

**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

Based on the checked boxes, the accident likely occurred as follows:

1.  Both vehicles were parked at the location.
2.  Vehicle A, which was parked, began to move, likely to leave a parking spot or maneuver.
3.  Vehicle A was moving in the same direction as Vehicle B, but on a different lane.
4.  Vehicle B was stationary, parked in its spot.
5.  The moving Vehicle A collided with the stationary Vehicle B, resulting in the accident.

---

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Under French traffic law, the driver who is moving is generally considered at fault when they collide with a stationary vehicle. In this case:

*   **Vehicle A (Lamisse, Pierre)** was moving while Vehicle B was stationary.
*   **Vehicle B (Dupont, Jean)** was parked and had no obligation to yield to a moving vehicle.

Therefore, **Vehicle A (Lamisse, Pierre) is likely at fault** for the accident. The fact that both vehicles had expired insurance policies is a separate legal issue and does not directly affect fault determination for the accident itself, although it may impact insurance claims.

---

**7. CONCLUSION**

The accident occurred on 04/12/2018 in Brussels, Belgium, when Vehicle A, driven by Pierre Lamisse, collided with stationary Vehicle B, driven by Jean Dupont. Based on the circumstances, Vehicle A was moving while Vehicle B was parked, making Vehicle A likely at fault. Both drivers had expired insurance policies, which is a separate legal issue.
