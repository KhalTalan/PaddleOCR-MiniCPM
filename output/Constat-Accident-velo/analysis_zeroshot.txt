5. **RECONSTRUCTION**
   - Based on the checkboxes from Section 12, it appears that Vehicle A was moving in the same direction as Vehicle B but changed lanes while Vehicle A was turning right. Vehicle B might have been reversing or changing lanes too. The exact positions at the time of impact can be inferred from the sketch in Section 13, but it is partially obscured.

6. **FAULT ANALYSIS**
   - Vehicle A's fault likely lies with changing lanes when another vehicle had the right of way (Box 10). Vehicle B seems to have been either reversing or changing lanes, which could lead to a collision if both vehicles were in close proximity.
   - Based on French traffic liability rules, Vehicle A would bear more responsibility due to changing lanes without ensuring safety first.

   - Location: ONDES (31)
   - Incident involved injuries and other damages to two vehicles.
   - Vehicle A driver Robert Guillaume changed lanes while turning right, leading to an accident involving Vehicle B driven by PUILOL.
   - Vehicle A bears primary fault due to lane change without proper signaling or checking for oncoming traffic.
