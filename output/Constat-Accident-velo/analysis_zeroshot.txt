#### Circumstances (Section 12):
For both vehicles, each checkbox represents a possible circumstance of the accident. Only checked boxes indicate what happened according to the report. Here are the checked boxes for each vehicle:

**Vehicle A Checked Boxes:**
1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

**Vehicle B Checked Boxes:**
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

### Reconstruction and Fault Analysis:
Based on the checked boxes, here's a reconstructed scenario:

**Vehicle A:**
- The driver was at an intersection or parking area.
- Vehicles were stationary or moving slowly.
- The driver made a turn (11) and possibly moved into another lane (10).
- The driver may have been changing lanes or turning without checking the surroundings (11).

**Vehicle B:**
- The driver approached from the same direction (16).
- Vehicles were either parked or moving slowly.
- The driver might have been turning or making a maneuver (12).
- The driver could have been reversing or making a tight turn (14).

### Conclusion:
Based on the checked boxes, it appears that Vehicle A turned or changed lanes without proper signaling or checking, leading to contact with Vehicle B. This suggests that Vehicle A may be primarily at fault due to their actions being less careful or attentive.
