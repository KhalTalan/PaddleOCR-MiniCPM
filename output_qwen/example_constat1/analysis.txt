**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

1.  Both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Rue de la Libération.
2.  Vehicle A was following Vehicle B.
3.  Vehicle B was turning right (Box 12 checked), which would have required it to signal (a legal requirement).
4.  Vehicle A was driving behind Vehicle B and hit its rear end (Box 8 checked), indicating it was either too close or failed to notice the turn.
5.  The driver of Vehicle A noted that Vehicle B had its turn signal off, which is a critical factor in the accident.
6.  The driver of Vehicle B noted that she was on her phone, which is a serious distraction and a violation of French traffic law.

---

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Based on French traffic law and the circumstances:

*   **Vehicle B (Anne Kervrian)** is **primarily at fault**.
    *   **Reason 1:** She was turning right without signaling, which is a clear violation of Article R213-1 of the French Road Code. This is a fundamental requirement for safe and predictable maneuvers.
    *   **Reason 2:** She was distracted by her phone, which is a significant contributing factor. While the law doesn't explicitly state that using a phone while driving is the cause of an accident, it is a serious violation of Article R213-11 (using a mobile phone while driving) and is considered a major factor in the accident.

*   **Vehicle A (Aymeric Faure)** may share some responsibility.
    *   **Reason:** He was driving too close to the vehicle in front of him, which is a violation of Article R213-1 (maintaining a safe distance). However, his primary responsibility was to be aware of the vehicle ahead, especially if it was turning.

---

**7. CONCLUSION**

The accident occurred when Vehicle B, without signaling and while distracted by her phone, turned right into the path of Vehicle A, which was following too closely. The driver of Vehicle B is primarily at fault for the violation of signaling and distraction, while the driver of Vehicle A shares some responsibility for not maintaining a safe distance. The damage to both vehicles is consistent with a rear-end collision.
