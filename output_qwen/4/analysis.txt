**4. CIRCUMSTANCES SUMMARY**

Based on the verified checkboxes:

*   **Vehicle A:** The only checked box is **[13] "virait gauche"** (was turning left). This indicates that Vehicle A was making a left turn at the moment of the accident.
*   **Vehicle B:** **No boxes are checked**. This implies that Vehicle B was not engaged in any of the listed specific maneuvers (e.g., parking, turning, reversing) at the time of the accident. The driver was likely proceeding straight or was stationary.

**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

1.  **Pre-accident Situation:** Both vehicles were on the road near the Boulevard de la Madeleine. Vehicle B was not performing any specific maneuver like turning or reversing. Vehicle A was approaching the intersection or area where the accident occurred.
2.  **The Maneuver:** Vehicle A was turning left (as indicated by the checked box 13). The driver of Vehicle A was likely in the process of completing a left turn.
3.  **The Collision:** As Vehicle A was turning left, it collided with Vehicle B, which was positioned on the left side of the road or in the same lane. The diagram shows Vehicle A impacting the left side of Vehicle B, causing damage to the rear left side of Vehicle A and the front left side of Vehicle B.
4.  **Post-accident:** Both drivers assessed the damage and filled out the report.

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Under French traffic law, the driver who is turning left (Vehicle A) has a higher duty of care. The driver turning left must yield to oncoming traffic and ensure it is safe to proceed.

*   **Vehicle A (Turning Left):** The driver was turning left, which inherently requires more attention and responsibility. The accident occurred while the vehicle was turning, and the damage was on the left side of Vehicle A, indicating it was the vehicle that initiated the maneuver.
*   **Vehicle B (No Maneuver):** The driver of Vehicle B was not turning or reversing. The lack of checked boxes for Vehicle B suggests it was not involved in any maneuver that would have caused the accident. The damage to Vehicle B's front left side indicates it was struck by Vehicle A.

**Conclusion:** Based on the circumstances, **Vehicle A is likely at fault**. The driver of Vehicle A was turning left and failed to ensure it was safe to do so, resulting in a collision with Vehicle B. The driver of Vehicle B was not engaged in any maneuver that would have contributed to the accident.

**7. CONCLUSION**

The accident occurred on October 28, 2020, at 12:40 PM on Boulevard de la Madeleine, where Vehicle A, driven by André Régillet, was turning left and collided with Vehicle B, driven by Mohamed Ferchi. The driver of Vehicle A is likely at fault for failing to ensure it was safe to turn left, as required by French traffic law. No injuries were reported, and both vehicles sustained damage to their left sides.
