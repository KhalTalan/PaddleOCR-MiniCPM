Based on the provided French Constat Amiable (Accident Report) and the verified checkbox data, here is a complete analysis:

---

**1. ACCIDENT DETAILS**

*   **Date & Time:** 16/12/2012 at 11:00 AM (11h00).
*   **Location:** ONDES (33) - This is likely a reference to the town of Ondes in the Gers department (32) or possibly a typo for "Ones" or "Ondes" in the Gers. The context of the accident sketch (near "Encanquet" and "Route de Saint-Cyprien") suggests it's in the Pyrenees region, but the exact location is ambiguous. The form is filled with "ONDES (33)", which is noted.
*   **Injuries:** No injuries (box "non" is checked for "blessé(s)" - injured person).
*   **Other Damage:** Yes, there are material damages (box "oui" is checked for "dégâts matériels" - material damage).
*   **Witnesses:** No witnesses are listed (the field is blank).

*   **Vehicle B (Car):** No checkboxes are marked. This means the driver of the car did not report any specific circumstances or actions leading to the accident.

**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

Based on the checked boxes and the accident sketch:

1.  **Initial Position:** The accident occurred on a road near "Encanquet" and "Route de Saint-Cyprien" (likely near Saint-Cyprien in the Pyrenees).
2.  **Vehicle A (Bicycle):** The bicycle was traveling in the same direction as the car (implied by the "heurtait l'arrière" checkbox and the sketch showing the bicycle behind the car). The bicycle driver was approaching the car from behind.
3.  **Vehicle B (Car):** The car was traveling in the same direction as the bicycle. The driver did not report any specific action (no checked boxes).
4.  **The Collision:** The bicycle driver (Vehicle A) hit the rear of the car (Vehicle B). The sketch shows the bicycle positioned behind the car, with the car moving forward and the bicycle hitting its rear.
5.  **Damage:** The bicycle sustained damage ("Cassé + Choc"), and the bicycle driver's phone, helmet, and shoes were damaged. The car driver reported "RAS" (Nothing to report), suggesting no damage to the car or no visible damage.

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

*   **French Traffic Law:** Under French traffic law, the driver of the vehicle that hits the rear of another vehicle is generally considered at fault, unless the other vehicle was at fault for stopping suddenly or was not following traffic rules.
*   **Circumstances:** In this case, the bicycle driver (Vehicle A) was the one who hit the rear of the car (Vehicle B). The car driver did not report any specific actions or circumstances, suggesting the car was likely moving normally.
*   **Conclusion:** The bicycle driver (Vehicle A) is likely at fault for the accident. The bicycle driver was the one who made contact with the car, and the car driver did not report any specific actions or circumstances that could have contributed to the accident.
