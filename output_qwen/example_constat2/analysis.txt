Based on the provided French *Constat Amiable d'Accident Automobile* (Mutual Accident Report), here is a complete analysis:

---

**2. VEHICLE A (Left)**

*   **Driver Name:** Robert Guillaume.
*   **Address:** Not fully legible, appears to be in the "33" department (Nouvelle-Aquitaine).
*   **Vehicle Details:** Vélo Look SSS (a bicycle, not a motor vehicle). This is a critical point, as the report is structured for motor vehicles. The vehicle type is likely a mistake or misclassification.
*   **Insurance:** Insurance company is "LIA" (likely a typo or abbreviation for "Liaisons" or "Liaisons Assurances"). Policy number is "13034512". The driver's license category is not specified, but the report indicates the vehicle is not insured for damage (Box 7 is marked "non").
*   **Damage Description:** "Cadre décaillé" (frame dented), "Cassé" (broken), "Cassé + Chaussettes" (broken + socks? - likely a typo for "Cassé + Chaussures" meaning broken + shoes, possibly referring to a broken bicycle frame or components). The driver's observation is "Telephone portable cassé + casque + chaussettes" (broken phone + helmet + socks), which is likely a misinterpretation of the damage description.
*   **Driver's Observation:** The driver observed "Telephone portable cassé + casque + chaussettes" (broken phone + helmet + socks), which is likely a misinterpretation of the damage description.

**5. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION**

Based on the checked boxes, the accident occurred as follows:

1.  **Vehicle A** was driving on a roundabout (sens giratoire).
2.  **Vehicle B** was approaching Vehicle A.
3.  The two vehicles collided. The report does not specify which vehicle was at fault or which vehicle was moving first, but the fact that Vehicle B was "heurtait l'arrivée de l'autre véhicule" suggests that Vehicle B was the one that struck Vehicle A.

---

**6. FAULT ANALYSIS**

Based on French traffic law and the circumstances:

*   **Vehicle A** was driving on a roundabout, which is a controlled intersection. The driver of Vehicle A was not observed to be violating any rules (e.g., no "n'avait pas observé un signal de priorité" box checked).
*   **Vehicle B** was approaching Vehicle A. The fact that Vehicle B was "heurtait l'arrivée de l'autre véhicule" suggests that Vehicle B was the one that struck Vehicle A. In French traffic law, the driver who strikes another vehicle is typically at fault, especially if the other vehicle was following the rules of the road.

Therefore, **Vehicle B is likely at fault** for the accident, as it was the one that struck Vehicle A while Vehicle A was legally driving on a roundabout.

---

**7. CONCLUSION**

The accident occurred on December 16, 2012, at 2:00 PM in ONDES, France, when Vehicle B struck Vehicle A while Vehicle A was driving on a roundabout. Vehicle B is likely at fault for the accident, as it was the one that struck Vehicle A while Vehicle A was following the rules of the road.
